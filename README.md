# Valet

## Philosophy

The chaos of starting and abandoning countless projects must be tamed. This manifesto serves as a guiding philosophy to organize, sustain, and curate the creative energy that goes into each project. By adhering to these principles, we ensure clarity, purpose, and longevity in our work.

### 1. Purposeful Naming

Each project must carry a name that reflects its intent and nature:
- **product_name**: For feature-complete, standalone endeavors. E.g. _valet_, _money_manager_.
- **learning-technology**: For exploratory ventures in understanding new tools or concepts. E.g. _learning-processing_, _learning-data_science_.
- **course_name**: For academic or certification-related projects. E.g. _python_101_, _data_science_101_, _the_complete_javascript_course_jonas_schmedtmann_.
- **product_name-owner**: For collaborations initiated by others but actively maintained. E.g. _valet-kavya_, _money_manager-anisu_.

Prohibited Naming Patterns:
- **product_name-technology**: Superfluous, as README.md should convey this. E.g. _valet-python_.
- **technology**: Too vague, lacking direction. E.g. _processing_, _web_.

### 2. The README Principle

Every project deserves its story:
- For _product_name_ and _product_name-owner_:
  - Define a clear goal.
  - Establish at least 3 milestones for measurable progress.
- For learning-technology and course_name:
  - Outline concise learning objectives.

Additional Essentials:
- Specify technology stack.
- Provide setup instructions for reproducibility.

### 3. Experimental Honesty

Experimental projects must declare their identity through proper naming conventions (Use directory naming conventions: _learning-technology_ or _course_name_).

### 4. Archival Wisdom

Projects stagnating for 6+ months without meaningful updates will find a resting place in the _archive_ directory. Before moving, summarize their status in the README.md as a final act of respect.

### 5. The Rule of Singular Purpose

Before embarking on a new project, review existing directories. Avoid duplicating efforts; consolidate when necessary.

### 6. Biannual Purge

Every January and July(or whenever feasible), dedicate time to clean the directory. Retain only what aligns with these principles.

### 7. Safeguarding Effort

- Backup Philosophy:
  - All _product_name_ projects require GitHub tracking unless explicitly exempt.
- Before skipping backups, ask:
  - Does it require version control (e.g., frequent updates or collaborators)?
  - Would its loss entail significant effort or emotional cost?
  - Temporary brainstorming projects may bypass this rule, but permanence demands preservation.

### 8. Collaborative Clarity

When stepping into collaborative efforts, respect origins by using _product_name-owner_ for proper attribution.

### Final Note

Let these principles serve as the compass that directs your creative endeavors toward purpose and sustainability. By honoring this structure, the clutter of abandoned starts becomes a testament to thoughtful growth and disciplined execution.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to build help users keep their personal project directory organized. That's all. Simple as that.

## Milestones

1. Valet can list out issues with the project directory in the console. 
2. Valet can automatically run every so often to check if the project directory is clean.
3. Valet can email the user if the project directory is not clean.
4. Valet can be customized to the user's preferences.
5. Valet has a GUI for the user to change settings.
6. Valet GUI helps the user to set up a new project.
